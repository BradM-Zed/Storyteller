Put your images in here.

Book illustrations should be in a sub-directory defined in your config.ini and have the filename "[pagenumber].jpg" or "[pagenumber].png".
They will be automatically sent along with the story when the appropriate page is turned to.
If the directory contains map.jpg or map.png, it will be sent when someone uses the !map command.

The emoji_cache sub-directory is used to mirror emoji images for use with discord. It will be populated automatically if Discord Mode is on.
